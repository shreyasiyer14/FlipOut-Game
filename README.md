FlipOut is a game my team had developed for a hackathon we had participated in. We were given 10 hours to complete the project and give a demonstration, and so I developed FlipOut! FlipOut is an arcade game, with real (legit!) retro chiptunes, 8bit graphics(!) , and also the classic arcade font! 

Making this game was really fun, and the concept of the game makes it addictive.

**Controls:**<br />
  So basically, you have to take control of the 'creeper', which flips about. You can change the direction of the flip by pressing "Space" bar in mid-air. The player is allowed to flip about the top and the ground layer, but if it collides with any other brick, you lose a life. Lose all the three lives, and the game is over!
<br />
  There are numerous bricks with question marks on them, which on being collected get added up to your inventory, and give you special powers and more!

**Installation Instructions:**
<br />
1) Download the repository as a .zip, and extract it on your system.
<br />
2) Now change your directory to the extracted folder, and then run the shell script 'INSTALL.sh', by typing:<br />
`chmod +x INSTALL.sh`
<br />
`./INSTALL.sh`
<br />
3) Now, with the dependencies installed, you are good to go! Fire up the game by typing: <br />
`python FlipOut!.py`
